",Microbial pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate chemotactic pathways facilitating the emigration of circulating maternal neutrophils from membranous decidual capillaries to the decidual-chorionic interface and beyond and from intervillous blood through subchorionic fibrin to the connective tissues of the chorionic plate plus or minus the overlying amnion.  ,"Microbial pattern-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate chemotactic pathways stimulating circulating fetal neutrophils to marginate on, transmigrate through, and enter the connective tissue around fetoplacental veins and arteries in the umbilical cord and/or chorionic plate. Fetal neutrophils in the chorionic plate may also enter the amniotic fluid and be aspirated into the fetal lungs.  ",Neutrophilic response to microorganisms entering the villous stroma from the maternal or fetal blood streams.,"Circulating organisms in maternal blood, most commonly viruses but occasionally spirochetes or protozoans (toxoplasma, trypanosomes), cross from the intervillous space through the villous trophoblast to enter the villous stroma, causing either a primary local infection or spreading back to the placenta villi as a consequence of systemic fetal infection.  The inflammatory response can be maternal and/or fetal in origin.","Viruses, fungi, chlamydia, rickettsia, and some parasites enter the intervillous space and elicit a maternal inflammatory response, especially in previously uninfected mothers.  Specific cellular receptors on trophoblast may facilitate placental sequestration in some cases (e.g. P. falciparum malaria).","Infection of maternal endometrium only without spread into chorionic tissues. Can precede pregnancy, be initiated by hematogenous spread of organisms during pregnancy, or in rare cases spread during gestation from contiguous organs (cervicovaginal tract, fallopian tubes, across myometrium).","The maternal immune system can react to noninfectious fetoplacental antigens in the context of immune dysregulation, host versus graft reactivity, or exposure to novel tissue specific (“oncofetal”) antigens particularly in the presence of inflammatory costimulatory signals.  Non-infection driven fetal immune responses may also occur (e.g. fetal eosinophilic/T cell vasculitis","Maternal T lymphocytes, most frequently of the CD8-positive memory phenotype, enter villi through breaks in the trophoblastic barrier, encounter fetal antigen on fetal macrophages, and in the proper costimulatory environment proliferate and undergo differentiation to an effector phenotype resulting in local stromal chronic inflammation in distal villi.","Maternal T lymphocytes, most frequently of the CD8 positive memory phenotype, enter villi through breaks in the trophoblastic barrier, encounter fetal antigen on fetal macrophages, and in the proper costimulatory environment proliferate and undergo differentiation to an effector phenotype resulting in diffuse chronic inflammation spreading within the villous tree and the release of T cell cytokines and chemokines into the fetal circulation.","Basal villitis may have a similar pathogenesis to chronic villitis, but is more likely to include B lymphocytes and is more frequent with prior genitourinary tract infections, morbidly adherent placentas (accreta), and preeclampsia.  It is also increased in ovum donation pregnancies and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia suggesting an alloimmune component in some cases.","Maternal inflammatory cells (approximately 80% CD68-positive monocyte-macrophages and 20% T lymphocytes with an equal CD4/CD8 ratio) accumulate within the intervillous space, often in contact with the surface of syncytiotrophoblast.  Evidence suggests an adaptive immune response to antigens, possibly paternally encoded, on the trophoblastic surface.  Frequently occurs in women with underlying autoimmune disease.","Like noninfectious chronic villitis (VUE), chronic chorioamnionitis is considered to be a maternal anti-fetal immune response.  Unlike VUE, it is most commonly observed in preterm gestations and the inflammatory infiltrate is limited to the membranes. The membranes constitute another fetomaternal interface where maternal immune cells in the decidua could react to fetal chorionic trophoblast. ","Poorly understood, but may represent either an immune-related adaptive immune response to allo-, auto-, tissue specific oncofetal, or microbial antigens.  Often accompanied by coexistant basal villitis.  Increased in cases with history of genitourinary infection, preeclampsia, or ovum donation pregnancy.","Very poorly understood, but could reflect excessive uterine NK cells, immune-related adaptive immune responses to allo- or autoantigens, or the remnants of old endometrial infection.  May overlap with chronic chorioamnionitis and lymphoplasmacytic deciduitis.","Considered a fetal response to vascular injury, but has a strong association with idiopathic chronic villitis (VUE) so maternal alloreactivity could play a role in initiation.  Anecdotally associated with later atopy in affected fetuses.  Occasionally associated with coexisting luminal thrombi.","Fetally derived (as determined by Y chromosome specific FISH in male fetuses) cellular inflammatory response most commonly accompanying other noninfectious chronic inflammatory conditions (villitis, chorioamnionitis, and deciduitis).  Also may be seen with prolonged meconium exposure or longstanding subacute infectious chorioamnionitis.","Abnormal gene expression (caused by teratogens, maternal/ fetal regulators) and/or physical forces (trauma, fetal movement, altered uterine geometry) lead to abnormal size, shape and structure or the presence of cells and tissues not usually found in normal placentas.  ","Extraplacental factors cause alterations in placentation, ventral embryonic body wall closure, early amniogenesis, or fetal placental vasculogenesis.","Current dogma is that monochorionic placentas develop in identical twins secondary to very late fission of the embryonic disk after the formation of a single placenta.  A contrarian view is that fission always occurs early and that monochorionic twins represent the secondary fusion of separate, but contiguous, early implanting blastocysts.  All monochorionic placentas are believed to have at least some shared fetal circulation: connection of arteries to veins or unequal perfusion pressure can cause intertwin shunting resulting in a spectrum of consequences listed in increasing order of gestational age at onset of development (see definitions): TRAP, TTS, TAPS, and CNS damage following stillbirth of the cotwin.  ","Pathogenesis is controversial in terms of which occurs first, early rupture of the amnion leading to fetal adhesions or abnormal body wall closure leading to primary failure in amnion development.  In the extreme phenotype, Type 3 UC agenesis -also known as Limb Body Wall Sequence, type 2, body stalk vessels travel outside the UC in a short membranous fold before directly inserting into the placenta.  Fetus typically has eventration of abdominal contents, cloacal abnormalities, and marked deformation of the limbs and spinal column secondary to forced apposition of the conceptus to the placenta and membranes.  The fetus is enclosed in amnion, but the abdominal contents are free in the extraembryonic coelom.","Fetal vasculogenesis in the chorionic plate is incompletely understood.  Developmental dysregulation may lead to nondichotomous (monopodal/magistral/perpendicular branching off a major trunk) branching, which is clinically benign, to incomplete coverage of the chorionic surface leading to parenchymal deficiencies in “watershed” zones between vessels.  These may predispose to growth restriction, preterm delivery, or vasa previa.  Placental shape abnormalities attributable to branching abnormalities can be detected as early as 14 weeks gestation by ultrasound.","Abnormally small placentas may accompany proportionally small fetuses, both of which lack abnormalities (constitutionally small) or may show evidence of pathologic processes associated with reduced placental growth (e.g. maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflammatory disorders, massive perivillous fibrin deposition).  Abnormally large placentas may accompany proportionally large fetuses, both of which lack abnormalities (constitutionally large) or may show evidence of pathologic processes associated with increased placental growth (e.g. diabetes, delayed villous maturation, fetal stromal-vascular overgrowth).  ","Abnormally large placentas may accompany proportionally large fetuses, both of which lack abnormalities (constitutionally large) or may show evidence of pathologic processes associated with increased placental growth (e.g. diabetes, delayed villous maturation, fetal stromal-vascular overgrowth).  Less common causes include edema (hydrops fetalis) and developmental abnormalities (e.g. Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome).","Abnormally small placentas may accompany proportionally small fetuses, both of which lack abnormalities (constitutionally small) or may show evidence of pathologic processes associated with reduced placental growth (e.g. maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflammatory disorders, massive perivillous fibrin deposition).  Less common causes are disadvantageous implantation site (e.g. underlying leiomyoma, lower uterine segment) and developmental anomalies (e.g. aneuploidy).",In most cases an increased fetoplacental weight ratio (FPR) is believed to reflect reduced placental growth (villous paucity and distal villous hypoplasia) due to the direct effects of maternal vascular malperfusion and the secondary effects of shunting fetal nutrients away from the placenta to other vital fetal organs.  Destruction of placental parenchyma by tissue necrosis may also contribute.,In most cases a decreased fetoplacental weight ratio (FPR) is believed to reflect increased placental growth (fetal stromal-vascular compartment) due to the direct effects of excessive placental growth factors and the secondary effects of fetal hyperinsulinemia related to maternal hyperglycemia.  Expansion of placental parenchyma by edema may also contribute.,"Abnormalities in early implantation, fetal chorionic vasculogenesis, and peripheral membrane formation can lead to irregular, multilobed, and abnormally sized placentas that are at risk for intrapartum complications or adverse outcomes.","Two theories have been proposed: (1) trophotropism which suggests that placentas become irregular by preferentially occupying richly vascularized uterine tissue and avoiding less well vascularized areas, such as the lower uterine segment, uterine scars, or leiomyomas.   (2) abnormal placental surface chorionic surface network which suggests that deficient growth and branching of large chorionic plate vessels in the late first trimester creates parenchymal deficiencies in “watershed” zones that cannot be completely “filled in” by later villous development.  The two theories are not mutually exclusive.","Bilobate placentation has been modeled by proposing an elongated axis of fetal chorionic vasculogenesis, stunted along its axis but more active at each end.  An older theory of bilobate placenta is that very early shallow implantation might lead to significant parenchymal development on both sides of the endometrial cavity.  Bilobate placentas are normally found in some lower primates.","Decreased maximum diameter has been related to superficial implantation and a lack of endovascular trophoblast plugs at the lateral edges of the implantation site.  This deficiency increases marginal oxygen tension, stimulates parenchymal to membrane conversion, and reduces the final placental diameter in one or more dimensions.  One theory posits that placental length (rostrocaudal) is genetically determined while breadth (lateral growth) is conditional based on the supply of maternal nutrients.  While possible biologic pathways can be envisioned, this hypothesis is largely speculative.","The transformation of the placenta from a homogeneous chorionic sac to a placental disc (chorion frondosum) and membranes (chorion laevae) occurs at around 8-10 weeks gestation.  Absence of extravillous trophoblastic plugs at the lateral margin of the placenta is believed to increase oxygen tension triggering villous involution and membrane formation.  A global reduction in endometrial blood flow could interfere with this process and some evidence suggests that placenta membranacea may be associated with endometrial chronic inflammation, mechanical injury, abnormal vascularization, and/or hypoplasia.  Placenta membranacea is normally found in some lower primates.","Deviations from normal may lead to absent or reduced fetal blood flow between fetus and placenta.  Consequences include elevated placental venous pressure, reduced fetal oxygenation, fetal hemorrhage, or arteriovenous shunts.",Umbilical cord length is primarily determined by stretching or lack thereof reflecting variations in fetal movement and/or restrictive entanglements,"Long umbilical cord is thought to reflect increased fetal movement leading to stretch-related remodeling.  Umbilical cord entanglements may also augment stretching and are another associated factor.  Consequences and complications of long umbilical cord include entanglement (e.g. nuchal or body cords), increased resistance owing to length alone (increased length causes increased resistance and decreased flow by Pouiselle’s law), and predisposition to excessive coiling and true knot formation, all of which can compromise fetoplacental perfusion.","Short umbilical cord generally reflects decreased fetal movement.  Causes can be separated into intrinsic or extrinsic categories.  The intrinsic group includes CNS and muscular anomalies, limb deficiencies, and urinary tract malformations associated with oligohydramnios.  The extrinsic group includes other causes of oligohydramnios, restrictive endometrial environment (e.g. bicornuate uterus of submucosal leiomyoma), and amniotic bands that tether the fetus to the placenta.  The most extreme example of the latter is early amnion rupture sequence which is occasionally associated with umbilical cord agenesis.","Thin umbilical cords are generally due to decreased amount and hydration of extracellular matrix (Wharton’s jelly).  Excessive twisting (hypercoiled umbilical cord) is incompletely understood and may either be a primary or secondary abnormality.  Hypercoiling or localized compression can lead to strictures.  Hypocoiled umbilical cord and thick umbilical cord (>2 cm diameter) are less well understood, but may also be associated with adverse outcomes.","Thin umbilical cords are generally due to a decreased amount and hydration of extracellular matrix (Wharton’s jelly) secondary to maternal vascular malperfusion and other causes of uteroplacental insufficiency.  Thick umbilical cord (>2 cm diameter), due to increased Wharton’s jelly, is less well understood but may also be associated with adverse outcomes","Most umbilical cords have an irreducible twist, fixed by the spiraling of the umbilical arteries around the vein.  This twist appears to be determined early in pregnancy and clockwise or left twisting is more common than right by a 7:1 ratio.  The underlying basis for the initiation, magnitude, and directionality of coiling is unclear, but data suggests that hypercoiled umbilical cords are more commonly right-twisted and that hypercoiled umbilical cords with a right twist are at higher risk for an adverse outcome than those with a left twist.  Adverse outcomes are largely restricted to hypercoiled umbilical cords with indentations.  Hypocoiled umbilical cord (one or fewer diagonal grooves/ 10cm) is less well understood, but may also be associated with adverse outcomes.","Strictures can be seen alone or combined with hypercoiling and cord indentations.  Animal studies have shown that transient cord compression in early pregnancy can also lead to stricture formation.  The most common site of stricture is at the fetal umbilicus, a finding that may be related to physiologic constriction near the umbilical ring after 20 weeks.",Theories explaining non-paracentral UC insertion overlap with those for abnormal placental shape.  Both processes appear to be largely determined early in pregnancy.  UC insertion is generally believed to be paracentral at the time of implantation.  Asymmetric development of placental parenchyma relative to the umbilical cord insertion site may be caused by preferential development in areas with better blood supply (“trophotropism”) or skewed chorionic surface vascular patterning during fetoplacental vasculogenesis.,Umbilical cord insertion is generally believed to be paracentral at the time of implantation.  Asymmetric development of placental parenchyma relative to the original insertion site due to either preferential development in areas with better blood supply (“trophotropism”) or skewed chorionic surface vascular patterning results in cord insertion in the membranous chorionic laevae at delivery.,Umbilical cord insertion is generally believed to be paracentral at the time of implantation.  Asymmetric development of placental parenchyma relative to the original insertion site due to either preferential development in areas with better blood supply (“trophotropism”) or skewed chorionic surface vascular patterning results in cord insertion at the margin of the placental disc at delivery.  Marginal insertion may be associated with a magistral or monopodal chorionic vessel branching pattern (perpendicular branching off a major trunk).  ,Umbilical cord insertion is generally believed to be paracentral at the time of implantation.  Asymmetric development of placental parenchyma relative to the original insertion site due to either preferential development in areas with better blood supply (“trophotropism”) or skewed chorionic surface vascular patterning results in cord insertion close to the margin of the placental disc at delivery.  Peripheral insertion may be associated with a magistral or monopodal chorionic vessel branching pattern (perpendicular branching off a major trunk).,"Pathogenesis is unknown, but unprotected vessels are susceptible to tearing or torsion with fetal movement or during parturition.","Pathogenesis is unknown, but fetal blood flow can be restricted if the umbilical cord is pulled in a direction opposite to that of the tethering fold of amnion.","Deoxygenated blood from the fetus is normally transmitted to the placenta via paired umbilical arteries that enter the cord at the umbilicus.  These arteries spiral around the umbilical vein and normally communicate with one another via the Hyrtl anastomosis, located within 3 cm of the cord insertion site into the placenta. Oxygenated blood from the placenta normally travels in a single (left) umbilical vein which drains to the ductus venosus and the fetal right atrium.  One umbilical artery may be lost or the second may never develop.  Umbilical veins are initially paired in the fetus and a persistent right umbilical vein can sometimes enter the umbilical cord.  Persistent small paired vitelline arteries initially accompany the omphalomesenteric duct through the placenta to the yolk sac.  All of these umbilical vessels may be damaged or form proliferative tumor-like lesions that are occasionally associated with a large adjacent pseudocyst.","Two theories: (1) primary failure of the vasculogenic mesenchyme flanking the allantoic duct to form two functional arteries and (2) secondary involution of an initially normal second artery.  The common association with membranous umbilical cord insertion suggests that mechanical factors might lead to obliteration of one artery, favoring the second theory.  Rare type II single umbilical arteries are true malformations associated with caudal maldevelopment (e.g. acardiac twin, sirenomelia, caudal regression syndrome) ","The single (left) umbilical cord vein normally joins paired intraembryonic umbilical veins just caudal to the fetal umbilicus.  The pre-hepatic portion of the right umbilical vein normally disappears at around 6 weeks gestation, but persistent flow in the umbilical cord may forestall involution.","Venous aneurysms are more common and typically occur in areas of extreme varicosity (large “false knots”).  They may be caused by sudden increases in tension with fetal cord entanglements.  Arterial aneurysms are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 18, and may follow thrombosis and medial degeneration.  ","Fetoplacental vessels have the capacity to undergo adventitial angiogenesis during development and this can be recapitulated in pathologic situations (e.g. prolonged bacterial infection).  Angiomyxomas most likely represent expansion of such foci into tumor-like masses.  Adjacent cyst formation is probably caused by transudation of fluid from the vascular component.  Whether they are reactive proliferations, malformations, or clonal neoplasms is not known.",These vascular malformative lesions are most likely related to abnormal development in regions near the branch points of umbilical and major chorionic vessels.,Vitelline vessels accompanying the omphalomesenteric duct in the umbilical cord may persist through part or all of the umbilical cord.  Benign vascular proliferations can arise where they terminate before reaching the yolk sac.,"Cysts confined to the UC are detected in 2-3% of first trimester ultrasounds, but are rare in later pregnancy.  They can form by obstructed outflow from epithelial ducts, surface invagination, or localized edema.",The allantoic duct is the extraembryonic extension of the urachus and provides a scaffolding for the placental chorioallantoic circulation.,The omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct connects the fetal intestinal tract to the yolk sac and is accompanied by small vitelline vessels that normally involute in early pregnancy.  ,Invagination of umbilical surface epithelium (which is embryologically related to amnion and fetal skin).,"Isolated pseudocysts represent exaggerations of commonly encountered foci of liquefaction within Wharton’s jelly and are increased with aneuploidy, particularly Trisomy 18.  Pseudocysts associated with angiomyxoma probably reflect transudation of fluid from the adjacent vascular lesion.  ","Origin is uncertain.  Hypotheses include displaced yolk sac elements (choristoma), ectopic embryonic tissues (heterotopias), or a monodermal teratoma.  Origin from displaced pluripotent stem cells is possible.","Origin is uncertain.  Hypotheses include ectopic migration of coelomic mesenchymal cells, embolic spread of adrenal progenitor cells, and origin from pluripotent embryonic or multi-potential placental stem cells.","Origin is uncertain.  Hypotheses include displaced yolk sac elements with hepatic differentiation (choristoma), ectopic embryonic liver (heterotopia) lacking portal structures, or a monodermal teratoma containing entirely hepatoid elements.  Origin from displaced pluripotent stem cells is possible.  ",Tumors arising from primitive villous trophoblastic precursors or germ cells in the yolk sac.  Remnants of an unrecognized acardiac or other resorbing twin gestation must be excluded.,Teratomas develop from primordial germ cells that arise in the dorsal wall of the yolk sac and are displaced from their normal migratory path to the fetal genital ridge.  Placental localization could occur by contiguous extension from the yolk sac or retrograde migration back through the body stalk (umbilical cord) from the primitive gut. ,"Only two cases reported, one associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  Neither metastasized to mother or infant.  Possible origins include primitive germ cells within the yolk sac or pluripotential stem cells.",Gestational choriocarcinomas usually arise from preceding diandric complete hydatidiform moles.  Intraplacental tumors that develop within apparently normal placentas may reflect androgenetic/ biparental mosaicism or have a distinct pathogenesis.,"Myometrial contractions, toxic exposures, and direct physical force can lead to cervical dilatation, premature rupture of the membranes, laceration of fetal vessels in the membranes or umbilical cord, and damage to fetal vessels and their supporting structures in the umbilical cord and chorionic plate.","Myometrial contractions, bacterial infections, and direct physical force contribute to premature cervical dilatation and/or rupture of the amnion, chorion, or both.","Longstanding decreases in amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios) cause fetal skin cells to become adherent to and incorporated within the amniotic epithelium, most likely due to amniocyte damage caused by increased contact between fetus and placenta and/or hyperconcentration of amniotic fluid.",The most widely accepted hypothesis is that early rupture of the amnion causes fibrous bands to form inside the remaining intact chorion which then encircle fetal structures or the umbilical cord.  Alternative suggestions suggest an underlying abnormality in the amnion and/or affected fetal parts (Streeter hypothesis).,Either late amnion rupture or late amniochorionic separation followed by amnion rupture.,"Large fetal vessels can be torn secondary to uterine instrumentation (amniocentesis, pressure catheters), tension (complete or partial avulsion of umbilical cord), or by laceration upon membrane rupture when vessels overly the cervical os (ruptured vasa previa).  In some cases, the ruptured vessels have preexisting defects caused by prolonged meconium exposure, pressure-related necrosis, or vascular thrombi.","Fetal gastric acid and bile-containing stool contents can enter the amniotic fluid due to upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction and antenatal defecation (meconium release), respectively.  These agents can cause tissue damage and dysfunction with prolonged exposure. Toxicity may be amplified by hyperconcentration with oligohydramnios, but this is less well established. ","Transient fetal hypoxia in mature fetuses leads to redistribution of blood flow away from fetal gut (“diving reflex”) resulting in defecation (meconium release).  Meconium contains bile acids, phospholipases, and other toxic stool components that can cause tissue necrosis or apoptosis. ","Remote or repetitive episodes of fetal defecation in response to hypoxia leads to meconium release without subsequent delivery.  Prolonged exposure in the absence of membrane rupture, especially with oligohydramnios, allows for progressive diffusion of toxic agents deep into the umbilical cord and chorionic plate causing vasospasm, vascular injury, and tissue necrosis.",Two etiologies: extremely prolonged amniotic fluid meconium exposure and fetal gastrointestinal tract obstruction leading to reflux of gastric acid into the amniotic fluid.,Genomic disorders lead to altered gene expression that may result in abnormal placental structure and function,Genomic structural abnormalities lead to changes in gene expression that can result in abnormal placental structure and function,Chromosomal abnormalities affecting both fetus and placenta lead to changes in gene expression that can result in abnormal placental structure and function,Chromosomal disorders confined to the placenta lead to changes in gene expression that may result in altered placental structure and function,Single gene defects affecting both fetus and placenta lead to changes in gene expression that can result in abnormal placental structure and function,Genomic disorders secondary to variations in parental DNA dosage lead to changes in gene expression attributable to differential imprinting that result in abnormal placental structure and function,"Increased levels of critical paternally-expressed gene products promote trophoblast proliferation.  Decreased levels of maternally-expressed gene products lead to truncated abnormal placental fetal stromal vascular development.  Usually caused by fertilization of an empty oocyte (lacking a maternally-derived pronucleus); monospermy with endoduplication or dispermy.  A rare, maternally heritable autosomal dominant trait associated with recurrent molar pregnancy is caused by an NLRP7 gene imprinting mutation, located on chromosome 19q13 that leads to over-expression of paternally-expressed transcripts.","Abnormal initial division of the fertilized egg in which the female genome fails to duplicate leaving one normal biparental daughter cell and the other containing only paternally-derived chromosomes.  Since YY androgenetic cells are nonviable, all cases are female.  Extent of placental involvement depends on the relative viability and function of the androgenetic clone which is usually restricted to villous mesenchyme (stroma and vessels).  Rare cases may show foci with androgenetic trophoblast (complete hydatidiform mole).","Syndrome characterized by abnormal expression of maternally and paternally imprinted genes at the chromosome 11p15.2 locus due to internal mutations, deletions, duplications, or partial uniparental disomy affecting specific genes in the 11p15.2 region and their imprinting control regions (IC1 and IC2).  IC2 abnormalities are associated with placental mesenchymal dysplasia; IC1 abnormalities with other pathologic findings including perivillous fibrin with trophoblast atypia.","Trisomic pregnancy, usually secondary to meiotic nondisjunction, with loss of the unaffected chromosome resulting in euploidy with uniparental origin for the two remaining chromosomes.  Dysregulation of parentally imprinted genes can lead to fetal malformations or growth restriction.","DNA alterations including, but not restricted to, promoter methylation and histone modification that affect gene expression but do not alter the genomic sequence."
